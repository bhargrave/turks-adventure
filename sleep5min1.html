  <h1>ADVENTURES WITH TURK<h1>
  <h2>As you close your eyes...</h2>

  <div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
    <p>To finally get that last 5 minutes of sleep, you hear a
      meow at your window.  Turk puts his paws up to the window, looking out
      curiously, tilting his head to one side.  You sigh loudly, “I never get to
       sleep in.”  You drag yourself out of bed and look out the window to see
       an incredibly beautiful cat sitting below.  She sashays closer, and
       unbelievably open her mouth and speaks!
     </p>
     <p>“Hello, I don’t think you and I know each other, but I’m friends with
     Turk.  My name is Mia Cavendish.  I came here today to invite you and Turk
     to come with me to Hollywood, where I am moving to start my career as an
     actress.  I need a roommate, and Turk has expressed his interest in going
     on an adventure.   Would you guys like to come with me to Hollywood?
