  <h2>It's a beautiful day outside...</h2>
  <div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
    <p>You arrive at the bus station, a little frazzled, but now determined to
      get to Hollywood with your friends. "Are you ready Mia?" you ask.</p>
    <p>"I'm so excited!" she is practically purring with anticipation.  She
      confidently walks up to the terminal and starts talking like Mia is apt to
      do.  "Hiya! I'm here to buy a ticket to Hollywood! I'm moving there to
      become an actress!""</p>
    <p>You roll your eyes at her over-sharing.  The older lady running the counter
      shakes her head at Mia.  "Look kid, Hollywood ain't no place for a nice cat
      like you. I tried my hand in Hollywood 20 years ago and ended up waitressing
      at Dennys for 10 years.  I changed my name and everything, trying to pretend
      I wasnt some small town girl.  It was a disaster, now go home and save
      your money for traveling or college or anything else." </p>
    <p>Mia looked a little shocked.  "My name is actually Mika Casas. That's so
      weird that you also changed your name.  I feel like I should trust you.
      I'm not going to Hollywood.  Guys we need to go home."</p>
