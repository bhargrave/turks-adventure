  <div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
    <p>Your head barely hits the pillow when you hear another sound.  This sound
      seems out of place. Your curiosity is telling you to get up and
      investigate, but you just want to sleep.  You can't remember the last time
      you were this tired.</p>
