  <h1>ADVENTURES WITH TURK</h1>
  <div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
    <p>You drag yourself out of bed, rub your eyes, and give Turk a pat.  "Yes,
      Yes we are going outside." As you search for your pants and shoes, you hear
      what sounds like a cat outside your window. You look out the window to see
      an incredibly beautiful cat sitting below.  She sashays closer, and
      unbelievably open her mouth and speaks!</p>
    <p>“Hello, I don’t think you and I know each other, but I’m friends with
    Turk.  My name is Mia Cavendish.  I came here today to invite you and Turk
    to come with me to Hollywood, where I am moving to start my career as an
    actress.  I need a roommate, and Turk has expressed his interest in going
    on an adventure.   Would you guys like to come with me to Hollywood</p>
