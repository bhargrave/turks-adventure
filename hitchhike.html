  <h1>ADVENTURES WIITH TURK</h1>
  <h2>Mia waves down a Jeep</h2>
  <div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
    <p>The first car the stops is being driven by a long-haired gray cat.  She
      looks intimidating and doesn't say anything, not even hello.  The 10
      minute drive in the beat up Jeep makes you uncomfortable, and Mia looks
      the same.  Turk doesn't seem to mind though, being a dog seems to make him
       unaware of socially awkward situations.  Finally you arrive at the bus
       station, the gray cat leaves you without as much as a goodbye, and that's
        okay with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Geez, I don't know about this Turk..." you mumble.  You start to think
      about the possibility of walking back home.
