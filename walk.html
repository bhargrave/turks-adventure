  <h1>ADVENTURES WITH TURK</h1>
  <h2>It's a beautiful day outside...</h2>
  <div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
    <p>
      You, Mia, and happy little Turk take off walking, suitcases in hand,
      towards the bus station.  You make it almost ten minutes without silently
      complaining to yourself.  You make it five more minutes before you complain
      out loud.  "Agh, its so hot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly seemed like a nice day when you agreed to walk.  Mia trys to
      stay positive "I think we are getting close," she says as she drags her
      comically small suitcase behind her.  Suddenly, you feel something wet and
      warm hit your shoulder.  A bird pooped on you.
