  <h1>ADVENTURES WITH TURK</h1>
  <h2>It's early morning...</h2>
  <div style="width: 60%; float: left;">
    <p class="sansserif">You open your eyes to the excited face of your fluffy white dog, looking
       at you expectedly as you roll over and cover your face with the pillow.
        “I could use five more minutes, Turk” you grumble at the dog. He wags
        his tail with excitement anyways, jumping on and off the bed.  He looks
        like he wants to go on an adventure.</p>
