    <p>“Come on Turk, I know you have always wanted to be in those Ceasar Dog
      Food commercials”  you joke.  You pack your and Turk’s bags.  Mia tells
      you more about herself “I am from a small town here in Northern
      California, but I’ve always dreamed of being an actress.  I finally saved
      enough for a bus ticket down there, and with your help, I have enough to
      move into a place.  By the way, are you guys okay with hitchhiking to the
      bus station, or do you want to walk?”
